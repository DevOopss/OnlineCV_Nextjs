## About The Project
<hr>
<h3> About the project</h3>

This project is meant as an introduction page for web developers, specifically front-end developers.

Feel free tu use this code, as long as the following conditions are met:

<ol>
<li>No economical profit is made out of this project before having my permission</li>
<li>No one takes credit nor ownership of this code</li>
<li>Whatever is made based on/of this code remains free and open-source.</li>

</ol>

<h4>Personal advice</h4>
<p>if you are indeed going to postulate as web developer, I recommend that you do not copy-paste this code as-is. I strongly recommend that you make your own code. If you want to copy the interface design be my guest, it is an excellent excercise. But if you copy-paste this code without knowing how to make it yourself, chances are you are going to get fired (or at least you may). </p>

I wish everyone a good day, and the best of lucks.
