## About The Project
<hr>
<h3> About the project</h3>

This project is meant as an introduction page for web developers, specifically front-end developers.

Feel free tu use this code, as long as the following conditions are met:

<ol>
<li>No economical profit is made out of this project before having my permission</li>
<li>No one takes credit nor ownership of this code</li>
<li>Whatever is made based on/of this code remains free and open-source.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Codes used in this project:</h3>
<ol>
<li>ω: Omega; Version of something that has just been started.</li>
<li>ψ: Psi; Version that does look a bit more like something someone can actually use.</li>
<li>φ: Phi; It kinda works but is till way far from being near finnished. </li>
<li> α: Alpha; Means what it always means.</li>
<li> β: Beta; Means what it always means.</li>
</ol>
It will be written like so:
V : X_n.n.n
(n numeration) where V stands for version, X for the correspondent greek letter, and each n stands for the correspondent numbers that belong to the set of natural numbers (including 0).
There is no rule regarding when a certain version of a greek letter becomes another number of another letter.
There is a file called version.md wich will ecplicit the version of the project. 
For final versions, it will be written like so:
V: f.f.f 
(where f is a natural number; f numeration)
Development versions after there is final version will be either:
f.f.f_X_m.m.m (where m is a natural number, and m numeration will start from 0.0.0 for each adition summed to the first f natural number, fm(x) numeration).   
or 
X_n.n.n 
where n keeps the numeration of previous dev versions (n numeration).
Release (r numeration): 
some final versions will be released, some will not be.
numeration: r
r = 1 is RTM


<h4>Personal advice</h4>
<p>if you are indeed going to postulate as web developer, I recommend that you do not copy-paste this code as-is. I strongly recommend that you make your own code. If you want to copy the interface design be my guest, it is an excellent excercise. But if you copy-paste this code without knowing how to make it yourself, chances are you are going to get fired (or at least you may). </p>

I wish everyone a good day, and the best of lucks.
